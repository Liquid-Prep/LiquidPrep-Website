Liquid Prep is an open-source project that originates from the winning team's idea of the Internal IBM Call for Code challenge in 2019.

Our team is dedicated to helping farmers in developing countries making the right decisions regarding watering their crops.

Our idea is to provide a very easy-to-use mobile application to provide watering advice to farmers. The solution uses a combination of diverse data of weather forecasts, crop information, and on-the-spot soil humidity measurements to generate watering advice. The advice is easily accessed on any mobile device that are used so frequently over the world. 

Participation is welcomed from software developers, designers, testers, agronomists/agri experts/soil experts, IoT engineers, researchers, students, farmers, and others that can help improve the quality and value of the solution for small farmers around the world. We welcome any contributions to our project - these could include expanding the use of various soil properties to improve the quality of the watering advice, localizing the mobile app, updating project documentation, hardware development/testing, more in-depth research, and adding data to our crop library/database.
